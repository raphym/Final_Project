## Abstract:

As part of the requirements for the BSc Software Engineering degree in 
Azrieli – College of Engineering Jerusalem, I will implement a final project for the company SHEMER ENERGY LTD.

This company develop a “smart city” and want to create a smart system to control the traffic in the city by automatically system and without control center.

I need to create an algorithm that will allow data routing in a distributed network.
Each node is a computer component with the ability to transmit and receive packets wirelessly. The difficulty is to create a decentralized network when each component can communicate only with its neighbors.
The routing solution that I implement is the construction of sub-graphs linked by nodes called "Quorums" that will help in the routing of the packages. (Backbones and Quorums)


The project ends with a demonstration of the algorithm by simulating events that come from an event journal that feeds events actions into the communications system.

In order to make measurements and comparisons with other networks, it is possible to run the simulation on all nodes of a particular network.

This mode is called "Test mode" and it allows you to check the ability of the system by sending packets from each node to each node.
The output of the simulation will help to improve the ability of the algorithm with statistics and data on the network information.

## How to run:
